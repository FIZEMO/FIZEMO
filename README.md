## HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE PROGRAM
   1. Clone the program
    
    git clone https://github.com/FIZEMO/FIZEMO.git
  2. Install all the necessary dependencies contained in [Detailed description](#packages-needed-before-program-execution) section.
  3. Customize the `config.json` file in the `./configuration` catalog according to your needs: you will find how to do this in the following sections.
  4. Put the signals you want to process as csv files into the `./signals` folder
  5. How to run the program:
      - If one runs program from developer tool like PyCharm:
        1. Set configuration parameter (command line parameters) as the path to configuration file (For PyCharm: Run->Edit Configurations and write in Parameters field the path to configuration file, for example "./configuration/config.json")
      - If one runs program from command line (for Windows users):
          1. Start Command Line and set path to the location where the main program is located (example C:\Documents\Projects\FIZEMO)
          2. Run main program with one attribute - the relative path to configuration file:
    
    py -3 main.py "./configuration/config.json"
    
    
**Results**: After successful run of the program you will find extracted features in `./results/features` catalog, and processed signal in `./results/signals` folder in files with the same name as you named the scenario. If you include more than one scenario in the configuration file, you will have more output files in those folders.
    
## Detailed description
Here are presented all the functions that can be used during signal processing.
Configuration file is a JSON file, which consists of flow scenarios for one signal. Each scenario has its own signal
processing flow (preprocessing methods and feature extraction order).
For each method there is a special name and attributes names that must be used and signed in configuration file.
For each feature extraction there is a special name that must be used and signed in configuration file.

This program gives complete freedom to the user so one can create many processing scenarios,
and each of them can be given any name. What is more, in each scenario many processing methods can be used in any order,
and one processing method can be used more than once in the single scenario.

As the result, for each scenario user receives .csv files which contains:
* extracted features from processed signal
    - only if at least one feature was specified in the scenario *(file placed in ./results/features/ directory).*
*  signal after all modifications and running processing methods *(file placed in ./results/signals/ directory).*

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the possibilities, take a look at the sample configuration file, and I'm
sure things will lighten up :bulb:.

***Examples of configuration files are placed in  ./configuration folder.***


## SCENARIO STRUCTURE
Each scenario defined in configuration file has a special structure. 
### It has to contain four elements:
  - `"signalFileName"` - a string representing the name of the file with signal which is placed in ./signals catalog 
     > *example: "./signals/rawGSR"*
  - `"signalType"` - a string representing a type of processed signal, it has to be chosen from the list of [available types of signal](#available-types-of-signal).
  - `"methods"` - list of methods for signal processing or feature extraction
  - `"columns_to_read"` - dictionary which contains information about columns to read from .csv file with signal data with specified "timestamp" column number and "values" column number

### There are two optional elements:
  - `"options"` - dictionary which may contain two elements (both optional):
    * `"save_processed_signal"` - if set to "False" the program doesn't save the .csv file with processed signal; if this field is not specified, the default value is "True"
    * `"draw_plot"` if set to "False" the program doesn't plot the processed signal; if this field is not specified, the default value is "True"
  - `"windowing_attr"` - dictionary which contains:  
    ***IMPORTANT: Not available for ECG signal yet - will come in future patches.***
    * `"length"` - the length of the window
    * `"slide"` - the slide of the window (windows can overlap)

## AVAILABLE TYPES OF SIGNAL
  - GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)
  - ECG (Electrocardiography)

## PROCESSING METHOD STRUCTURE 
We call methods for processing signal inside `"methods"` array inside config file.
To call function for processing signal in configuration file one has to fill 3 elements:
  - `"functionName"`: "..." - the name of the function one wants to use (string),
  - `"order"`: ... - natural number bigger or equal 1 which indicates the order of processing flow (int),
  - `"attributes"`: { #attributes } - attributes that are unique for each function; they specify function parameters. For some functions this element might be omitted (for example look at [Z NORMALIZATION](#z-normalization) function).

**Example for method that filter the signal with butterworth filter:**
```json
"methods": [
  {
    "functionName": "butterworth_filter",
    "order": 1,
    "attributes": {
      "filterOrder": 5,
      "samplingRate": 250,
      "type": "bandpass",
      "cutOfFrequencies": [
        5,
        15
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "functionName": "z_normalize",
    "order": 2
  }
]
```
