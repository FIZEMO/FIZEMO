1. DESCRIPTION
    Here are presented all the functions that can be used during signal processing.
    Configuration file is a JSON file, which consists of flow scenarios for one signal. Each scenario has its own signal processing flow (preprocessing methods' order).
    For each method there is a special name and attributes names that must be used and signed in configuration file.

2. METHOD STRUCTURE
    To call function in configuration file one has to fill 3 elements:
    "function_name": ...,
    "order": ...,
    "attributes": { #attributes }

    *   function_name - name of the function one wants to use
    **  order - natural number bigger or equal 1 which indicates the order of processing flow
    *** attributes - attributes that are unique for each function; they specify function parameters
