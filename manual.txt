1. DESCRIPTION
    Here are presented all the functions that can be used during signal processing.
    Configuration file is a JSON file, which consists of flow scenarios for one signal. Each scenario has its own signal
    processing flow (preprocessing methods and feature extraction order).
    For each method there is a special name and attributes names that must be used and signed in configuration file.
    For each feature extraction there is a special name that must be used and signed in configuration file.

2. METHOD STRUCTURE
    To call function for processing signal in configuration file one has to fill 3 elements:
    "function_name": ...,
    "order": ...,
    "attributes": { #attributes }

    *   function_name - name of the function one wants to use
    **  order - natural number bigger or equal 1 which indicates the order of processing flow
    *** attributes - attributes that are unique for each function; they specify function parameters;
        For some function this element might be omitted (look at [Z NORMALIZATION] function).

3. AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS

    [DECIMATION]
    Description:  process of bandwidth reduction (filtering) and sample-rate reduction
    Function name: "decimate"
    Attributes:
        "samplingFrequency" - frequency with which signal was sampled (integer - [Hz])
        "goalFrequency" - goal frequency with which signal should be sampled (integer - [Hz])

    [Z NORMALIZATION]
    Description:  process of normalizing signal with algorithm Z
    Function name: "z_normalize"
    Attributes: None

4. FEATURE EXTRACTION STRUCTURE
    To call function for feature extraction from the signal in configuration file one has to fill 3 elements and:
    "function_name": ...,
    "order": ...,
    "output_label": "..."

    *   function_name - name of the function one wants to use
    **  order - natural number bigger or equal 1 which indicates the order of processing flow
    *** output_label - optional elements where user can define label for extracted feature.
        If this element is omitted, program will generate default output label for a feature.
